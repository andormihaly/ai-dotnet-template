# Clean Architecture

## Core Principles

1. **Dependencies point inward.** `Domain` has no project references. `Application` references only `Domain`. `Infrastructure` references only `Application`. `Api` references `Application` and `Infrastructure`.
2. **Keep framework concerns out of Domain.** Domain code should model business concepts and rules without ASP.NET Core, EF Core, Azure SDK, or infrastructure dependencies.
3. **Organize application behavior around cohesive use cases.** Do not introduce CQRS, mediator libraries, command/query abstractions, or additional patterns unless the project needs them.
4. **Infrastructure is a plugin.** Persistence, external APIs, messaging, file storage, and similar concerns live in Infrastructure and implement contracts exposed by Application.
5. **Api is the composition root.** Controllers translate HTTP concerns into application calls and map results back to HTTP responses. Keep business logic out of controllers.

```

## Patterns

### Application Contract, Infrastructure Implementation

Define a contract in Application when application behavior needs an external capability. Implement that contract in Infrastructure.

```csharp
public interface IClock
{
    DateTimeOffset GetUtcNow();
}
```

Infrastructure supplies the implementation and registers it through `InfrastructureServicesRegistration`.

### Thin Controllers

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/orders")]
public sealed class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{id:guid}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Delegate application behavior to the Application layer.
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

Controllers should handle routing, HTTP-specific validation/binding, authorization intent, and response mapping—not business rules.

### Service Registration

Use the existing registration classes:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApplicationServices();
builder.Services.AddInfrastructureServices(builder.Configuration);
```

## Anti-patterns

- Do not reference Infrastructure or Api from Domain or Application.
- Do not place EF Core, HTTP clients, Azure SDK clients, or file-system code in Domain.
- Do not place business logic in controllers.
- Do not introduce a generic repository abstraction that simply mirrors `DbSet<T>` operations.
- Do not introduce architecture patterns only for future possibilities.

## Decision Guide

| Question | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Where does a business rule belong? | Domain when it is intrinsic domain behavior; otherwise Application when it coordinates a use case. |
| Where does an external service implementation belong? | Infrastructure. |
| Where does the interface for an external capability belong? | Application when Application depends on that capability. |
| Where does HTTP-specific behavior belong? | Api. |
| Should a new abstraction be introduced? | Only when it solves a concrete current requirement. |
