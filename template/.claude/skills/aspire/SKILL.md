# .NET Aspire

Aspire is an orchestration and developer-experience layer for distributed applications. It should be introduced when it solves a real orchestration, dependency, observability, or local-development problem—not simply because the application uses .NET.

Detailed guidance is split into references so it can be loaded only when relevant:

- [CLI and setup](references/cli-and-setup.md)
- [AppHost and resources](references/apphost-and-resources.md)
- [Observability and MCP](references/observability-and-mcp.md)
- [Testing and deployment](references/testing-and-deployment.md)

## Core Principles

1. **AppHost describes the distributed application.** It orchestrates projects, containers, executables, and external resources; it is not a business-logic layer.
2. **Use references instead of hardcoded local endpoints.** Let Aspire provide service-discovery and connection information where supported.
3. **Keep shared technical defaults out of business projects.** ServiceDefaults may centralize common health, telemetry, discovery, and resilience configuration when Aspire is adopted.
4. **Use integrations when they simplify resource wiring.** Do not add an Aspire integration without a resource or operational need.
5. **Treat the dashboard as an observability/development tool.** Production behavior must not depend on the dashboard.
6. **Keep deployment choices explicit.** Aspire can help model and publish distributed applications, but target-platform architecture still matters.

## Common Pattern

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.AiDotNet_Api>("api")
    .WithReference(cache)
    .WaitFor(cache);

builder.Build().Run();
```

## When to Use Aspire

Good candidates include:

- multiple services/resources that are difficult to run together locally;
- databases, caches, brokers, or emulators that need repeatable orchestration;
- service discovery between local components;
- a distributed application that benefits from a unified telemetry/dashboard experience;
- polyglot services that need one orchestration model.

Aspire is optional for a single simple API with no orchestration need.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not put domain or application behavior in AppHost.
- Do not hardcode resource endpoints that can be supplied through references.
- Do not introduce Aspire solely to obtain a dashboard.
- Do not require the Aspire dashboard for production operation.
- Do not assume local orchestration automatically defines a production deployment architecture.
- Do not add resources/integrations that the application does not use.

## Decision Guide

| Scenario | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Single API, no dependent resources | Aspire is optional |
| Several services/databases/caches need local orchestration | Aspire is a strong candidate |
| Shared health/telemetry/discovery defaults across services | Consider ServiceDefaults |
| Need to inspect running distributed resources with AI tooling | Consider Aspire MCP integration |
| Need production deployment | Load the deployment reference and validate target-platform requirements |
